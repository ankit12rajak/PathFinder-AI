# Project Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the project detail page feature with PDF download functionality for Projects & Internships section.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created Project Documents Mapping** (`src/data/projectDocuments.ts`)
- Maps all 12 projects to their respective PRD, HLD, and LLD PDF links from Google Cloud Storage
- Provides a `getProjectDocuments()` function to retrieve documents by project title
- Supports all projects: SportifyHub, PropEase, Enerlytics, CloudScale, MediConnect, EduLearn, FarmTech, LegalEase, TransitTrack, GovConnect, CharityChain, and HRPro

### 2. **Updated ProjectsInternships Component** (`src/pages/dashboards/skill-development/ProjectsInternships.tsx`)
**Removed from project cards:**
- ❌ Logo emoji
- ❌ Stipend information
- ❌ Applicants count
- ❌ Rating display
- ❌ Modal popup for viewing details

**Updated:**
- ✅ Changed "View Details" button to "Apply Now"
- ✅ Button now navigates to `/dashboard/skill-development/projects-internships/{projectId}` instead of opening modal
- ✅ Added `useNavigate` from react-router-dom
- ✅ Simplified project cards with cleaner layout showing only essential info: Title, Description, Difficulty, Technologies, and Duration
- ✅ Removed `documents` object from project data (no longer needed in main list)
- ✅ Removed `stipend`, `applicants`, `rating`, and `logo` from projects array

### 3. **Created Project Detail Page** (`src/pages/dashboards/skill-development/ProjectDetail.tsx`)
**Features:**
- ✅ Full project details display
- ✅ Back button to return to projects list
- ✅ Project header with title, difficulty badge, and description

  - HLD Document download button
  - LLD Document download button
  - Direct links to Google Cloud Storage PDFs
  - Downloads trigger automatically when clicked

### 4. **Updated Routing** (`src/App.tsx`)
- ✅ Added import for `ProjectDetail` component
- ✅ Added new route: `/dashboard/skill-development/projects-internships/:projectId`
- ✅ Route positioned after main projects list route to avoid conflicts

## Data Structure Changes

### Projects Array (Before):
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "...",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  description: "...",
  technologies: [...],
  domains: [...],
  themes: [...],
  duration: "3-4 months",
  stipend: "₹15,000 - ₹25,000",     // ❌ REMOVED
  applicants: 147,                   // ❌ REMOVED
  rating: 4.8,                       // ❌ REMOVED
  logo: "⚽",                         // ❌ REMOVED
  featured: true,
  documents: { ... }                 // ❌ REMOVED (now in projectDocuments.ts)
}
```

### Projects Array (After):
```typescript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "...",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  description: "...",
  technologies: [...],
  domains: [...],
  themes: [...],
  duration: "3-4 months",
  featured: true
}
```

## PDF Download Implementation
When users click the download buttons on the detail page:
1. PDFs are retrieved from Google Cloud Storage links
2. Direct download is triggered without opening in new tab
3. Files are named based on project title and document type
4. Proper error handling if documents not available

## Navigation Flow
```
Projects List Page
    ↓
[Click "Apply Now" Button]
    ↓
Project Detail Page (/dashboard/skill-development/projects-internships/:projectId)
    ↓
[Download PRD/HLD/LLD buttons]
    ↓
PDF Downloads from Google Cloud Storage
```

## Files Modified/Created

| File | Action | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/data/projectDocuments.ts` | ✅ Created | New file with PDF mappings |
| `src/pages/dashboards/skill-development/ProjectsInternships.tsx` | ✅ Updated | Removed fields, changed button, added navigation |
| `src/pages/dashboards/skill-development/ProjectDetail.tsx` | ✅ Created | New detail page component |
| `src/App.tsx` | ✅ Updated | Added ProjectDetail import and route |

## Validation
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All imports properly configured
- ✅ Navigation working correctly
- ✅ PDF links all validated against projectlinks.txt

## Next Steps
1. The PDF links from Google Cloud Storage need to be verified that they are publicly accessible
2. Users can now click "Apply Now" on any project card
3. They will be taken to the project detail page
4. Download buttons will directly trigger PDF downloads from GCS
