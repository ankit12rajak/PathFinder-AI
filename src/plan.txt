✅ 1.Create a new service: geminiCodingQuestionService.ts
✅ Generate 2 coding questions dynamically based on role, company, and position level
✅ Include problem statement, examples, constraints, test cases
✅ Generate starter code templates for multiple languages (JS, Python, TS, Java, C++)
✅ Include expected time/space complexity
✅ Include hints and multiple approaches
✅ Include fallback questions if API fails

✅ 2.Enhance geminiCodeService.ts
✅ Add time/space complexity analysis
✅ Add test case validation with detailed results
✅ Add comparison with optimal solution
✅ Enhanced analysis with complexity explanations

✅ 3.Update MachineCoding.tsx
✅ Fetch dynamic questions on component mount
✅ Display 2 questions with navigation between them (Previous/Next buttons)
✅ Show time/space complexity analysis in results
✅ Add test case execution and validation
✅ Show loading state while fetching questions
✅ Display hints progressively
✅ Show question counter (Question 1 of 2)
✅ Enhanced UI with complexity comparison cards
✅ Test case results visualization

NEXT PHASE: SANDBOX CODE EXECUTION
==========================================

🎯 OBJECTIVE: Implement real code execution for all languages (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, C++)

📋 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: See SANDBOX_EXECUTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md

⏰ PHASE 1: Judge0 API Integration (6 days)
⏳ Day 1: Set up Judge0 API account & credentials
⏳ Day 2: Create codeExecutionService.ts
⏳ Day 3: Create hybridCodeAnalysisService.ts (Real execution + AI analysis)
⏳ Day 4: Update MachineCoding.tsx with new execution handler
⏳ Day 5: Test all 5 languages + edge cases
⏳ Day 6: Security hardening + deployment

🚀 PHASE 2: Google Cloud Run (Optional - Production Scale)
🔮 Week 1: Docker container setup for each language
🔮 Week 2: Cloud Run deployment + API gateway

💰 COST ESTIMATION:
   - Judge0 RapidAPI: $10/month (10K requests)
   - Google Cloud Run: ~$0.40 per million requests

🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
   ✓ CPU time limit: 2-5 seconds
   ✓ Memory limit: 128-256 MB
   ✓ No network access
   ✓ Input validation & rate limiting

📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   ✓ Real execution for all 5 languages
   ✓ < 3 seconds total execution time
   ✓ 100% test case validation accuracy
   ✓ Combined AI analysis + real output

****Google Cloud Storage Options for Questions & Answers****
Recommended: Firestore (Best for this use case)
Type: NoSQL document database
Why:
Real-time sync capabilities
Easy querying by role/company/level
Built-in indexing
Excellent for structured data like questions
Free tier: 1GB storage, 50K reads/day
